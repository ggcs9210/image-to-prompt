An advanced **image-to-prompt reverse engineering tool** powered by **OpenAI CLIP** and exposed via a modern **Gradio Web UI**.

This project allows you to upload any image and automatically generate the most relevant textual prompt concept. It is particularly useful for:

- Reverse engineering prompts for Stable Diffusion / Midjourney / Flux  
- Building image understanding or tagging pipelines  
- Content analysis and retrieval  
- Teaching and experimenting with multimodal AI models
